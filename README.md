<h1 align='center'>Generative Art</h1>

A repository dedicated to programmatic methods for the creation of art. 

So far both audio and still visual mediums have been considered. 

My work with generative audio has yet to be traferred over to this new more general "generative art" repo. 

For still visual, so far I have explored varying levels of abstraction including: 

- [Processing: Programming Language Designed for Creating Images, Animation, and Interactivity](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/generative-art/tree/main/processing)

and 

- [Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)](https://github.com/wyattowalsh/generative-art/tree/main/GANs)

---

This repository holds my notes and code implemented so far for my ideas. If examined, it can be seen that important files are missing from this reposistory, such as my data, processing sketches, etc. Since I haven't quite figured out my decision on whether to fully open-sounce my endeavors in generative art, so if interested in this source code, please reach out to me.
